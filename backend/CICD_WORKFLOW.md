# Backend CI/CD Workflow Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the CI/CD workflow implemented for the Aqua Stark backend service. The workflow ensures code quality, security, and reliability through automated testing and validation processes.

## Workflow File

The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/backend.yml` and is triggered on:

- Push to `main` branch with changes in `backend/**`
- Pull requests to `main` branch with changes in `backend/**`

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Environment Setup

- **Node.js 20**: Latest LTS version for optimal performance and security
- **Working Directory**: `./backend` for all operations
- **Cache**: npm cache for faster dependency installation

### 2. Code Quality Checks

#### Formatting Check

- Uses Prettier to ensure consistent code formatting
- Command: `npm run format:check`
- Validates that all code follows the project's formatting standards

#### Linting

- Uses ESLint to check code quality and potential issues
- Command: `npm run lint`
- Enforces coding standards and catches common errors

### 3. Security Analysis

#### Dependency Audit

- Runs `npm audit --audit-level=moderate`
- Identifies known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Fails the build for moderate and higher severity issues

#### High Severity Vulnerability Check

- Additional check for high severity vulnerabilities
- Provides warnings without failing the build
- Allows for manual review and decision making

### 4. Testing

#### Unit Tests

- Runs Jest test suite
- Command: `npm test`
- Ensures all functionality works as expected

#### Coverage Report

- Generates test coverage reports
- Command: `npm run test:coverage`
- Uploads coverage data to Codecov for tracking

### 5. Database Migration Validation

#### Migration Files Check

- Validates Supabase migration files
- Checks for proper SQL syntax
- Ensures migrations contain standard SQL operations
- Reports the number of migration files found

### 6. Build Verification

#### Entry Point Validation

- Verifies that `src/index.js` exists
- Ensures the main application entry point is present

#### Dependency Validation

- Checks that all required dependencies are present in `package.json`
- Required dependencies:
  - express
  - cors
  - helmet
  - compression
  - morgan
  - dotenv
  - ws
  - redis
  - @supabase/supabase-js
  - jsonwebtoken

### 7. Environment Configuration

#### Environment Variables Documentation

- Validates that `env.example` file exists
- Checks for documentation of required environment variables:
  - DATABASE_URL
  - REDIS_URL
  - JWT_SECRET
  - PORT

### 8. Code Quality Analysis

#### TODO/FIXME Detection

- Scans for TODO, FIXME, and HACK comments
- Provides warnings for incomplete work
- Helps maintain code quality standards

## Scripts Added to package.json

The following npm scripts were added to support the CI/CD workflow:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint:fix": "eslint src/ --fix",
    "format:check": "prettier --check src/",
    "audit": "npm audit --audit-level=moderate",
    "audit:fix": "npm audit fix",
    "validate": "npm run lint && npm run format:check && npm run test"
  }
}
```

## Configuration Files

### .prettierrc

- Prettier configuration for consistent code formatting
- Matches the project's coding standards

### .prettierignore

- Excludes unnecessary files from formatting
- Improves workflow performance

### .eslintrc.cjs

- ESLint configuration for code quality enforcement
- Customized for Node.js backend development

## Success Criteria

The workflow is considered successful when:

- ✅ All code quality checks pass
- ✅ Security audits show no critical vulnerabilities
- ✅ All tests pass with coverage
- ✅ Database migrations are valid
- ✅ Build verification completes
- ✅ Environment configuration is properly documented

## Failure Handling

- **Formatting Issues**: Code must be formatted according to Prettier standards
- **Linting Errors**: Code must pass ESLint checks
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Moderate+ severity issues will fail the build
- **Test Failures**: All tests must pass
- **Missing Dependencies**: Required dependencies must be present
- **Invalid Migrations**: Migration files must contain valid SQL

## Local Development

To run the same checks locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run all validations
npm run validate

# Format code
npm run format

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Check for security issues
npm run audit
```

## Integration with Existing Workflows

This backend workflow complements the existing workflows:

- **frontend.yml**: Frontend-specific CI/CD
- **contracts.yml**: Smart contract validation
- **general.yml**: General project checks
- **codeql.yml**: Security analysis

The backend workflow is designed to run independently and efficiently, only triggering when backend-related files are modified.

## Monitoring and Notifications

- **Success**: Clear success message with all passed checks
- **Failure**: Detailed failure message with guidance
- **Coverage**: Automatic upload to Codecov for tracking
- **Security**: Warnings for high severity vulnerabilities

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the workflow:

1. Integration with Supabase CLI for migration validation
2. Docker image building and testing
3. Performance testing
4. API endpoint testing
5. Database connection testing
6. Deployment automation
