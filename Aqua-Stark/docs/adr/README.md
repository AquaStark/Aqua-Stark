# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Aqua-Stark project. ADRs are used to document important architectural decisions made during the development of the project.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the development of a project. They provide context for why certain decisions were made, what alternatives were considered, and what the consequences of those decisions are.

## ADR Index

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| [ADR-0001](./0001-initial-architecture.md) | Initial Architecture Decisions | Accepted | 2024-12-19 |

## Template

Use the [template](./template.md) to create new ADRs. Follow the guidelines in the template for consistent formatting and content.

## Process

1. **Create**: Use the template to create a new ADR with "Proposed" status
2. **Review**: Share with the team and stakeholders for feedback
3. **Refine**: Update the ADR based on feedback and discussions
4. **Accept**: Change status to "Accepted" when the decision is approved
5. **Implement**: Follow the implementation notes and track progress
6. **Update**: Change status as needed (Deprecated, Superseded, etc.)

## When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when making decisions that:
- Affect multiple components or systems
- Change the technology stack
- Introduce new design patterns
- Break existing APIs or interfaces
- Impact performance or scalability
- Affect security architecture
- Have long-term consequences for the project

## Benefits

- **Documentation**: Provides historical context for decisions
- **Communication**: Helps team members understand why decisions were made
- **Onboarding**: Helps new team members understand the project architecture
- **Reflection**: Allows the team to learn from past decisions
- **Consistency**: Ensures architectural decisions are made thoughtfully
